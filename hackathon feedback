Chat app.
First of all good job on your project!
Using sockets, nodejs for rendering front end and nice styling!
I wanted to ask why is there an edit button on the message that is sent from the other user? 
Also I did not see any use of database(let me know on slack if i missed it!).
Good use of dom manipulation ,adv array methods and functions.
